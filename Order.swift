 TODOs
 -make all labels have lines = 0 (they cut off on my phone)
 -get all sides, toppings, options in one table view with 3 prototype cells and sections?
 -when there is no options and it autosegues, still need to make a button to progress in case they go back
 -add/delete the tab where things are customized. also, do something about it not having a menuItem, causes crash
 -when you select an option, then go through the order flow and then go all the way back, the options disappear next time
